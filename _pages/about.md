Hi! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Political Science, <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/IfPol/personen/leuschner.html">University of Münster</a> at Daniel Bischof’s chair for Comparative Politics. At the moment, I am working on the relation between protest and public opinion. 
In 2025, I defended my <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2077/84117">PhD</a> on the causes and consequences of government responsiveness to protests at the University of Gothenburg. My research has been published in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals, such as _Comparative Political Studies_ and _Political Behavior_, and more is hopefully to come!

Besides this ongoing work on protests, I have also published on political biases in evaluations of International Organizations in _Review of International Organization_ and _Public Administration Review_.

Throughout my research projects, I employ a variety of quantitative and computational methodologies, such as econometrics, survey experiments, and machine learning.

Have a look around and feel free to reach out!
