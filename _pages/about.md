Hi! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg where I study the causes and consequences of government responsiveness to protest. First papers for my thesis have been published in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals, such as _Comparative Political Studies_ and _Political Behavior_, and more is to come! 

Besides this ongoing work, I have also published on political biases in evaluations of International Organizations in _Review of International Organization_ and _Public Administration Review_. 

Throughout my research projects, I employ a variety of quantitative and computational methodologies, such as econometrics, survey experiments, and machine learning.

Have a look around and feel free to reach out!
