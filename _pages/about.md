Hi! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg. In my thesis, I study the determinants and effects of government responsiveness to protest. The first paper for my thesis has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_ and hopefully, more is to come! 

Besides this ongoing work, I have also published on political biases in evaluations of International Organizations in the journals Review of International Organization and Public Administration Review. 

To work on my broad research agenda, I employ a variety of quantitative and computational methods, such as econometrics, survey experiments, and machine learning.

Before starting my Ph.D., I graduated from two Master's programs at the universities of Konstanz and Gothenburg.

Have a look around and feel free to reach out!
