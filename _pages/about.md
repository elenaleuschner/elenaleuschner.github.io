Hi! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg where I study the causes and consequences of government responsiveness to protest. The first paper for my thesis has been published in _Comparative Political Studies_ and hopefully, more is to come! 

Besides this ongoing work, I have also published on political biases in evaluations of International Organizations in the journals _Review of International Organization_ and _Public Administration Review_. 

Throughout my research projects, I employ a variety of quantitative and computational methodologies, such as econometrics, survey experiments, and machine learning.

Have a look around and feel free to reach out!
